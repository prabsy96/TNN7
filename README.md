# TNN7: A Custom Macro Suite for Implementing Highly Optimized Designs of Neuromorphic TNNs

_TNN7_ a suite of nine highly optimized custom macros developed using a predictive 7nm Process Design Kit (PDK), to enhance the efficiency, modularity and flexibility of the TNN design framework. Macros can be referenced through the .lib and .lef files, developed using the ASAP7[] transistor model files. This work is accepted and will be presented in ISVLSI 2022.
